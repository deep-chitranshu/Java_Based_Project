Abstract Class:
	-An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keywords
	
-Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details
 and showing the only functionality (function declaration) to the user.
 
-Can not make object of abstract class directly, but through derived class
	
	
	 -example of abstract method ?
	 
	  Abstract class may consists of abstract and non-abstract method.
	 -(0-100%) abstract methods can be there !
	 
In case of Interface 100% abstract method should be there!

Final class  - is a class which you cannot inherit into another class

-The main purpose of using a class being declared as final is to prevent the class from being 
	-If a class is marked as final then no class can inherit any feature from the final class.
	-You can't extend a final class. If you try it gives you a compile time error.
	
	
	NOTE : - YOU CANNOT INHERIT ONE ABSTRACT CLASS INTO ANOTHER BUT YOU CAN INHERIT ONE INTERFACE INTO ANOTHER..
