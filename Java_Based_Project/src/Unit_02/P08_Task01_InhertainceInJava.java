/* Inheritance in Java
Inheritance is a property or feature of OO langugage that allows it inherit one class into another.
Class which is inherited is called Super class.
Class which inherited the Super Class is called Child class.

In child class you can get access to public, protected members but you can't access private member of Super class

To achieve Inhertiance use  -- extends -- keyword.
Types of Inheritance - 
	1. Multi-level Inheritance
	2. Single Inheritance
	3. hybrid Inheritance (but it will be like a tree)
	4. Heirarchial Inheritance
	
	Multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java so as to remove Diamond Problem from its root
	and to recover the features of Multiple Inheritance we use Interface(Java's Own Concept)
	
	 
	 About the constructor -- the constructor of Super class will execute first after that of child class will execute.
